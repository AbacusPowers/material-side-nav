# Material Design Side Nav for WordPress

This plugin provides an options page where you can add post types (or other links) to your side navigation. You will need to provide the URL, text and icon for each link in the navigation. The options page also allows you to set the icon to be used for the drawer pull tab.

Live demo can be seen on the left side at http://godcloud.org
